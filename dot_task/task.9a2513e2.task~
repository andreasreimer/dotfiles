# The 'task <id> edit' command allows you to modify all aspects of a task
# using a text editor.  Below is a representation of all the task details.
# Modify what you wish, and when you save and quit your editor,
# Taskwarrior will read this file, determine what changed, and apply
# those changes.  If you exit your editor without saving or making
# modifications, Taskwarrior will do nothing.
#
# Lines that begin with # represent data you cannot change, like ID.
# If you get too creative with your editing, Taskwarrior will send you
# back to the editor to try again.
#
# Should you find yourself in an endless loop, re-editing the same file,
# just quit the editor without making any changes.  Taskwarrior will
# notice this and stop the editing.

# Annotations look like this: <date> -- <text> and there can be any number of them.
# The ' -- ' separator between the date and text field should not be removed.
# Multiline annotations need to be indented up to <date> (21 spaces).
# A "blank slot" for adding an annotation follows for your convenience.
