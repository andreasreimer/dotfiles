,About this file,"This file has multiple sheets with data for one or more indicators used by Gapminder. In this sheet below you'll first find an overview of the indicators (measures) and the list of underlying sources. The actual data we use, is found in the sheet(s) labeled ""data-..."".
This file is also a documentation of the data process. To follow how the data was transformed from the original sources, start in the sheet to the far right, which holds the input data. You can then follow the process step by step, by looking at the formulas in the sheets from right to left, until you reach the output in the ""data-..."" sheets.",,,,,

,Dataset description:,"ICT Data   are published by  International Telecommunication Union. ITU collects,verifies and harmonizes telecommunication/ICT statistics for about 200 economies worldwide. Telecommunication/ICT data are mainly collected from national telecommunication/ICT ministries, regulatory authorities and national statistical offices.In this spreadsheet we have imported data on one ICT's  indicator, ""percentage of the population using the internet"" and presented data for countries and territories for the period  1990-2019 in Gapminder's standard format to allow visualization in our tools. We have also compiled the global share  of people using internet and  extended the trend  earlier in the past based on data of share of the population using the internet which was published by ITU. The global trends of internet users starts from 1980 where Gapminder estimated that nobody was using the Internet in 1980, as it was invented the year after, in terms of a shared protocol ( see: https://web.archive.org/web/20120518101749/http://www.isc.org/solutions/survey/history) .  In addition, we have estimated the number of people using internet based on data of share of the people using the internet with countries' population data (gm-population V6 which is based on population data from WPP 2019). We computered data for regions using ITU data and global data share of the people using and not using the internet by combining the data reported by World Bank and ITU in a single dataset.",,,,,
